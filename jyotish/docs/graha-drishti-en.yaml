      A graha not only influences the rashi in which it is posited or if it is the
      lord of the rashis, but it also affects other rashis that it aspects. The
      effect can be good or bad. If the aspecting planet is friendly to the lord of
      the rashi, then it will benefit the rashi. On the other hand, if the aspecting
      planet considers the rashi lord as an enemy, then there is an adverse effect
      on the rashi. Not only the rashis it aspects, but the planets located in those
      rashis are also impacted by the aspecting planet. The aspect of a friendly
      planet strengthens the  planet, while the aspect of an enemy planet weakens it.
