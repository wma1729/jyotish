      Rahu-Ketu are special. They are not assigned any exaltation-debilitation
      rashi. Most astrologers agrees that Rahu is exalted in Taurus and
      debilitated in Scorpio whereas Ketu is exalted in Scorpio and
      delibilitated in Taurus. Some believes that Rahu is exalted in Gemini
      and debilitated in Sagittarius whereas Ketu is exalted in Sagittarius
      and debilitated in Gemini. And then there are some who considers that
      both Rahu-Ketu are exalted in Scorpio and both are debilitated in Taurus.
      They believe that Sun-Saturn, Mars-Jupiter, and Mercury-Venus form
      opposite-pair. Similarly Moon forms the opposite-pair with Rahu-Ketu. 
    - >-
      Rahu-Ketu are not given lordship over any rashis though the predominant
      view is that Rahu and Ketu are lords of Aquarius and Aries respectively.

      An exalted graha is very strong. Exaltation simply refers to its strength.
      It need not always give favorable and good results. If it is functional
      malefic, it can give very bad results.
    - >-
      A debilitated graha is not always bad. If the graha is acting as a
      functional malefic, debilitation takes away its strength to act in an
      malefic way.
    - A graha in its own rashi always give favorable results.
