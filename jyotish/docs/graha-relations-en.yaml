      Like humans, there is a mutual relationship between the grahas. This
      relationship can be natural (same for all the natives) or temporal (based
      on the planetary positions in the birth chart).

          To know the natural friends and enemies of any planet, see the
          mool-trikona rashi of that planet. The lords of 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12
          rashis from the mool-trikona rashi of a graha and the lord of the
          graha's exaltation rashi are considered natural friends of a graha.
          The remaining lords (1, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11) are natural enemies. If a
          graha is both a friend and an enemy, it is considered neutral.

          Example - Saturn's Moolatrikona sign is Aquarius. Saturn is exalted in
          Libra. 2 (Jupiter), 4 (Venus), 5 (Mercury), 8 (Mercury), 9 (Venus) -
          Saturn is also exalted here, 12 (Saturn) - ignore it, are natural
          friends of Saturn. 1 (Saturn) from Aquarius - ignore it, 3 (Mars), 6
          (Moon), 7 (Sun), 10 (Mars), 11 (Jupiter), are natural enemies of
          Saturn. Guru is both a friend and an enemy - so it should be
          considered neutral.

          A planet maintains mutual friendship with other planets that are
          posited in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 10th, 11th, 12th rashis. The planets
          posited in other rashis are considered mutual enemies.

  remarks:
    - >-
      Rahu and Ketu are special. As per Phal-Deepika of Mantreshwar, Mercury,
      Venus, and Saturn are friends, Mars is neutral, Sun, Moon, and Jupiter
      are enemies of both Rahu and Ketu though some considers Jupiter along
      with Mars as neutral. But some other experts use the friends, neutrals,
      and enemies of Saturn for Rahu and of Mars for Ketu.

      Natural friend + temporary friend = best-friend. Natural friend +
      temporary enemy = neutral. Natural neutral + temporary friend =
      friend. Natural neutral + temporary enemy = enemy. Natural enemy +
      temporary friend = neutral. Natural enemy + temorary enemy = worst-enemy.
    - >-
      Whenever the result is stated on the basis of friendship in Yoga formation
      or Dasha predictions, one should always look at natural friendship only.
      The temporary friendship should only be consulted when the best-friend
      or the worst-enemy is clearly stated. The temporary friendship is
      considered while evaluating temporary situations over a short duration.
    - >-
      Natural relationships are not reciprocal. For example, Mars considers
      Saturn to be equal but Saturn considers Mars to be an enemy. If Saturn is
      placed in Aries (owned by Mars), it will not lose its energy as it is
      equal to Mars but Saturn, being the enemy of Mars, will try to harm the
      house.
