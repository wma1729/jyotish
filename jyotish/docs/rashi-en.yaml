          Arians are proud, independent and adventurous. They like to roam
          around and usually end up moving away from their homeland. They
          prefer not to settle down early in life. If the position of Mars
          is strong in the horoscope, the travel brings joy and profit. On
          the other hand if the Mars is weak, the travel brings expenses,
          losses, and pain. They are extroverts, courageous, fiery, and
          impatient. They can get frustrated soon if things do not go their
          way. They have a tendency towards violence and are prone to accidents.
          They are innovative, ambitious, great motivators/leaders and love
          to pioneer things.

          Taureans exhibit strength (both physical and mental). They have a
          relaxed disposition and do not get angry soon but, once irked, they
          become an irresistible force. They are hardworking and do not rest
          until the task is completed. They are artistic, sensual and intelligent
          and can earn money because of their intelligence (like becoming writers,
          teachers, etc.). They love comfort, luxuries and food and can be good
          cooks. They do not get a lot of success in their relationships. They
          often submerge their individuality to make the relationships work but
          to no avail. They get little to no benefits from siblings and friends.

          Gemini natives have both male and female energies within themselves.
          They are very intelligent and materialistic. They are rarely content
          and/or tranquil as there is always an inner conflict in them. They
          often incur expenses through children. They are dual-minded, be it
          relations or residence or profession. They are inclined towards art
          but might not do well in arts as a profession. They are very talkative
          and misspeak once in a while. They can be drawn to spirituality but
          because of their intelligence and materialistic nature, their approach
          is more philosophical rather than devotional. The health is usually
          unstable. Even if there is nothing major, they suffer from minor ailments.

          major decisions/actions. They are often disappointed with their
          children. They are career oriented. They make friends and associates
          quickly. Their fickle nature tends to create enemies as well. They

  remarks:
    - As per Phal-Deepika of Mantreshwar, Gemini is also both-way-rising rashi.
    - >-
      A natural benefic planet becomes more benefic in a head-rising rashi
      and loses some of its benefic nature in a back-rising rashi. Likewise,
      a natural malefic planet becomes more malefic in a back-rising rashi
      and loses some of its malefic nature in a head-rising rashi.
