          Arians are proud, independent and adventurous. They like to roam
          around and usually end up moving away from their homeland. They
          prefer not to settle down early in life. If the position of Mars
          is strong in the horoscope, the travel brings joy and profit. On
          the other hand if the Mars is weak, the travel brings expenses,
          losses, and pain. They are extroverts, courageous, fiery, and
          impatient. They can get frustrated soon if things do not go their
          way. They have a tendency towards violence and are prone to accidents.
          They are innovative, ambitious, great motivators/leaders and love
          to pioneer things.

          Taureans exhibit strength (both physical and mental). They have a
          relaxed disposition and do not get angry soon but, once irked, they
          become an irresistible force. They are hardworking and do not rest
          until the task is completed. They are artistic, sensual and intelligent
          and can earn money because of their intelligence (like becoming writers,
          teachers, etc.). They love comfort, luxuries and food and can be good
          cooks. They do not get a lot of success in their relationships. They
          often submerge their individuality to make the relationships work but
          to no avail. They get little to no benefits from siblings and friends.

          Gemini natives have both male and female energies within themselves.
          They are very intelligent and materialistic. They are rarely content
          and/or tranquil as there is always an inner conflict in them. They
          often incur expenses through children. They are dual-minded, be it
          relations or residence or profession. They are inclined towards art
          but might not do well in arts as a profession. They are very talkative
          and misspeak once in a while. They can be drawn to spirituality but
          because of their intelligence and materialistic nature, their approach
          is more philosophical rather than devotional. The health is usually
          unstable. Even if there is nothing major, they suffer from minor ailments.

          Cancerians, like crab, have a hard shell with a soft emotional side
          underneath. They appear highly intellectual, rational and pragmatic.
          But in times of crisis, the emotions bubbles up and rules all their
          major decisions/actions. They are often disappointed with their
          children. They are career oriented. They make friends and associates
          quickly. Their fickle nature tends to create enemies as well. They
          usually benefit from enemies but on occasions lose as well. They are
          very attached to their home/family. They are secretive. Their marriages
          could be delayed or have problems.

          Leo natives are proud, arrogant, royal and have a tendency to be served.
          They pretend to be courageous but are usually blusterous i.e. they threaten
          often but fight rarely. They can be harsh to their siblings, especially
          the younger ones. They are self-centered, aspiring, ambitious and often
          get involved in politics and government. They like to invest in property.
          Their fathers can be important people in society. They try to dominate in
          their marriages and partnerships and hence are disappointed in the long run.

          Virgo natives are shy with an interest in purity. They like to take care
          of others and excel in healthcare. They are very intelligent and educated
          which makes them fit for analysis and calculations. They learn to develop
          new skills in their trade. They have unusual, somewhat out of the box,
          approaches to various problems. They encounter marital difficulties and
          troubles from their children. They are picky eaters. They are prone to
          accidents and surgeries.

          Librans are usually retailers or merchants. They also like public professions.
          They have difficulties in controlling their expenses and tend to waste their
          resources, both physical and financial. They might also get into sexual
          escapades which they regret later. They do not like good counsel from others.
          They like friends, clubs and societies. But they often get involved in bad
          companies. They are fashion conscious. They have a strong interest in politics.
          They lead a happy married life.

  remarks:
    - As per Phal-Deepika of Mantreshwar, Gemini is also both-way-rising rashi.
    - >-
      A natural benefic planet becomes more benefic in a head-rising rashi
      and loses some of its benefic nature in a back-rising rashi. Likewise,
      a natural malefic planet becomes more malefic in a back-rising rashi
      and loses some of its malefic nature in a head-rising rashi.
