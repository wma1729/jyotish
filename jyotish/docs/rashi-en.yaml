    - >-
      A natural benefic planet becomes more benefic in a head-rising rashi
      and loses some of its benefic nature in a back-rising rashi. Likewise,
      a natural malefic planet becomes more malefic in a back-rising rashi
      and loses some of its malefic nature in a head-rising rashi.
